.SH NAME
tnmMap \- A Tcl/Tk package for manipulating network maps.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION

The tnm map(n) command provides a common infrastructure used to build
simple but powerful network management tools which can easily exchange
their configuration databases. This package extends the map(n) command
with a library of Tcl procedures that are used to implement common
functions used within different applications.

.SH USING THE PACKAGE

The tnmMap package is loaded into a Tcl interpreter by using the
following sequence of Tcl commands:

.CS
package require tnm
.br
package require tnmInet $tnm(version)
.br
package require tnmMap $tnm(version)
.CE

All the tnmMap commands live in the tnmMap namespace. You can import
these commands into the current namespace by using the following Tcl
command:

.CS
namespace import tnmMap::*
.CE

It is however suggested to import commands explicitely or to use the
full name in scripts to avoid name clashes.

.SH COMMANDS

.TP
.B tnmMap::getIpAddress \fInode\fR
The \fBtnmMap::getIpAddress\fR procedure returns the IP address of a
map item. It first checks whether the first element of the value of
the -address option contains a valid IP address. If not, it tries to
lookup an IP address by using the value of the -address option as an
argument to tnmInet::getIpAddress. The next attempt is to call
tnmInet::getIpAddress with the value of the -name option. An error is
generated if all lookup attempts fail. The \fBtnmMap::getIpAddress\fR
procedure saves the IP address in the -address option if the lookup
was successful and the option has been empty to ensure that future
lookups are faster.

.TP
.B tnmMap::getIpName \fInode\fR
The \fBtnmMap::getIpName\fR procedure returns the IP name of a map
item. It first checks whether the -name option contains a suitable
value. If this test fails, an attempt is made to convert the value in
the -address option into a name. The -name option will be updated if
the conversion is successful and the -name option is currently empty.
An error is thrown if all attempts to retrieve an IP name fail.

.TP
.B tnmMap::getSnmpSession \fInode\fR
The \fBtnmMap::getSnmpSession\fR procedure returns an SNMP session
handle which can be used to send SNMP requests to a map item. This
procedure first checks whether the tnm:Snmp:Alias attribute is
defined. It tries to create an SNMP session using the value of
tnm:Snmp:Alias as an alias name if it is not empty. The procedure
looks at the attribute tnm:Snmp:Config if the attribute tnm:Snmp:Alias
is not defined. It tries to create an SNMP session using the value of
tnm:Snmp:Config as a list of configuration options if it is not empty.
Finally, the procedure tries to get the IP address using the
\fBtnmMap::getIpAddress\fR procedure and it initializes an SNMP
session with this IP address and the default parameters. Errors are
generated if the attempts to create a session fail.

.TP
.B tnmMap::traceRoute \fInode\fR [\fImaxlength\fR [\fIretries\fR]]
The \fBtnmMap::traceRoute\fR procedure traces an IP route using the
van Jacobsen algorithm. The procedure creates one or more events while
tracing the route to \fInode\fR. The \fImaxlength\fR parameter defines
the maximum route length and the \fIretries\fR parameter the number of
retries per hop. The default values are a maximum length of 32 hops
and 3 retries per hop.

The procedure generates a series of \fItnmMap:traceRoute:Value\fR
events to report the result of each tracing step. The end of the
routing trace is signalled by a \fItnmMap:traceRoute:Done\fR
event. The node should have appropriate event bindings to handle these
events.

The \fBtnmMap::traceRoute\fR procedure will throw an error if it fails
to retrieve an IP address for the node or there is an error while
sending and receiving ICMP messages.
