.SH NAME
tnmScriptMib \- A Tcl package of procedures for interacting with the IETF remote scripting MIB.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION

The tnmScriptMib package provides a set of Tcl command procedures that
interact with SNMP agents implementing the remote scripting MIB
standardized by the Distributed Management (DISMAN) working group of
the IETF. Most of the commands work synchronously which means that
they might block the process for a while if there are communication
problems.

.SH USING THE PACKAGE

The tnmScriptMib package is loaded into a Tcl interpreter by using the
following sequence of Tcl commands:

.CS
package require tnm
.br
package require tnmScriptMib $tnm(version)
.CE

All the tnmScriptMib commands live in the tnmScriptMib namespace. You
can import these commands into the current namespace by using the
following Tcl command:

.CS
namespace import tnmScriptMib::*
.CE

It is however suggested to import commands explicitely or to use the
full name in scripts to avoid name clashes.

.SH COMMANDS

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::getLanguages \fIsession\fR
The tnmScriptMib::getLanguages procedure returns the list of languages
supported by an SNMP agent identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR
handle. Each element in the result list contains the language index
(smLangIndex) and the language identification (smLangLanguage).

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::getExtensions \fIsession\fR \fIlanguage\fR
The tnmScriptMib::getExtensions procedure returns the list of extensions
for a given language supported by an SNMP agent identified by the SNMP
\fIsession\fR handle. The \fIlanguage\fR parameter is the language
index (smLangIndex) which identfies a language within an agent. Each
element in the result list contains the extension index (smExtsnIndex)
and the extension identification (smExtsnExtension).

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::installScript \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR \fIlanguage\fR \fIsource\fR \fIdescription\fR 
The tnmScriptMib::installScript procedure installs a new script at the
agent identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR handle. The new script will
be owned by \fIowner\fR and named \fIname\fR. These two attributes
uniquely identify the script. The script is written in the language
identified by the \fIlanguage\fR parameter. Upon a subsequent
tnmScriptMib::enableScript call the agent will retrieve the script
file from the URL specified by the \fIsource\fR parameter. The
\fIdescription\fR parameter can be used to pass a verbose description
of the script.

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::deleteScript \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR
The tnmScriptMib::deleteScript procedure deletes a script owned by
\fIowner\fR and named \fIname\fR from the agent identified by the SNMP
\fIsession\fR handle.

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::enableScript \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR
The tnmScriptMib::enableScript procedure adminstratively enables the
script owned by \fIowner\fR and named \fIname\fR at the agent
identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR handle.

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::disableScript \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR
The tnmScriptMib::disableScript procedure adminstratively disables the
script owned by \fIowner\fR and named \fIname\fR at the agent
identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR handle.

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::setScriptStorage \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR \fIstorage\fR
The tnmScriptMib::setScriptStorage procedure sets the storage
type (smScriptStorageType) of the script owned by \fIowner\fR and
named \fIname\fR at the agent identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR handle
to the value \fIstorage\fR.

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::setScriptDescription \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR \fIdescription\fR
The tnmScriptMib::setScriptDescription procedure sets the description
string (smScriptDescr) of the script owned by \fIowner\fR and
named \fIname\fR at the agent identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR handle
to the value \fIdescription\fR.

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::setScriptSource \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR \fIsource\fR
The tnmScriptMib::setScriptSource procedure sets the source URL
string (smScriptSource) of the script owned by \fIowner\fR and
named \fIname\fR at the agent identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR handle
to the value \fIsource\fR.

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::setScriptLanguage \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR \fIlanguage\fR
The tnmScriptMib::setScriptLanguage procedure sets the language
index (smScriptLanguage) of the script owned by \fIowner\fR and
named \fIname\fR at the agent identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR handle
to the language index \fIlanguage\fR.

.B tnmScriptMib::installLaunch \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR \fIscriptowner\fR \fIscriptname\fR \fIargument\fR \fIlifetime\fR  \fIexpiretime\fR  \fImaxrunning\fR \fImaxcompleted\fR
The tnmScriptMib::installLaunch procedure installs a new launch button
at the agent identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR handle. The new
launch button will be owned by \fIowner\fR and named \fIname\fR.
These two attributes uniquely identify the launch button.  It will
launch the script owned by \fIscriptowner\fR and named
\fIscriptname\fR. When the script is launch it will get passed the
argument string \fIargument\fR. The initial values of the maximum
lifetime and the time until terminated scripts expire for running
instances of scripts started from this launch button will be
\fIlifetime\fR and \fIexpiretime\fR. The maximum number of running
scripts started from this launch button will be \fImaxrunning\fR.
The maximum number of terminated scripts that have been started from
this launch button and remain in the smRunTable will be \fImaxcompleted\fR.

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::deleteLaunch \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR
The tnmScriptMib::deleteLaunch procedure deletes a launch button owned by
\fIowner\fR and named \fIname\fR from the agent identified by the SNMP
\fIsession\fR handle.

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::enableLaunch \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR
The tnmScriptMib::enableLaunch procedure adminstratively enables the

identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR handle.

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::disableLaunch \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR
The tnmScriptMib::disableLaunch procedure adminstratively disables the
launch button owned by \fIowner\fR and named \fIname\fR at the agent
identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR handle.

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::suspendRun \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR \fIindex\fR
The tnmScriptMib::suspendRun procedure suspends the
running script that has been started from the launch button 
owned by \fIowner\fR and named \fIname\fR and that has the smRunIndex
value \fIundex\fR at the agent identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR handle.

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::resumeRun \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR \fIindex\fR
The tnmScriptMib::resumeRun procedure resumes the suspended
running script that has been started from the launch button 
owned by \fIowner\fR and named \fIname\fR and that has the smRunIndex
value \fIundex\fR at the agent identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR handle.

.TP
.B tnmScriptMib::abortRun \fIsession\fR \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR \fIindex\fR

value \fIundex\fR at the agent identified by the SNMP \fIsession\fR handle.

.SH NOTES

The tnmScriptMib package is still missing some useful procedures, e.g.
for starting scripts. These functions have to be achieved by issueing
lower level SNMP operations from the application.
