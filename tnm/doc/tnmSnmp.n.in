.SH NAME
tnmSnmp \- A Tcl package of SNMP-based utility procedures.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION

The tnmSnmp package provides a set of Tcl command procedures to talk
to SNMP agents. Most of the commands work synchronously which means
that they might block the process for a while if there are
communication problems. The result of some of the procedures is
returned in a human readable format ready for displaying in a window
or printing to a file. The main purpose of these functions is
therefore to retrieve information that is displayed in a
user-interface and not further processed by software.

.SH USING THE PACKAGE

The tnmSnmp package is loaded into a Tcl interpreter by using the
following sequence of Tcl commands:

.CS
package require tnm
.br
package require tnmSnmp $tnm(version)
.CE

All the tnmSnmp commands live in the tnmSnmp namespace. You can import
these commands into the current namespace by using the following Tcl
command:

.CS
namespace import tnmSnmp::*
.CE

It is however suggested to import commands explicitely or to use the
full name in scripts to avoid name clashes.
