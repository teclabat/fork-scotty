.SH NAME
tnmTerm \- A Tcl/Tk package for simple output terminals
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION

The tnmTerm package provides a set of Tcl/Tk command procedures used
to create and display simple output terminals.

.SH USING THE PACKAGE

The tnmTerm package is loaded into a Tcl interpreter by using the
following sequence of Tcl commands:

.CS
package require tnm
.br
package require tnmTerm $tnm(version)
.CE

All the tnmTerm commands live in the tnmTerm namespace. You can
import these commands into the current namespace by using the
following Tcl command:

.CS
namespace import tnmTerm::*
.CE

It is however suggested to import commands explicitely or to use the
full name in scripts to avoid name clashes.

.SH COMMANDS

.TP
.B tnmTerm::open \fIpath\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::open\fR procedure creates a new output terminal.
The terminal is created with the given widget \fIpath\fR.

.TP
.B tnmTerm::clear \fIpath\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::clear\fR procedure removes all the text from the
output terminal and positions the curser in the first line and
first column.

.TP
.B tnmTerm::write \fIpath\fR \fItext\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::write\fR procedure appends the \fItext\fR at the end
of the text in the terminal window identified by \fIpath\fR.

.TP
.B tnmTerm::setName \fIpath\fR \fIname\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::setName\fR procedure sets the name of the terminal
window identified by \fIpath\fR. The \fIname\fR is displayed in the
title bar of the window manager.

.TP
.B tnmTerm::setIcon \fIpath\fR \fIbitmap\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::setIcon\fR procedure sets the bitmap icon displayed
when the output terminal window identified by \fIpath\fR is iconified.

.TP
.B tnmTerm::toggleFreeze \fIpath\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::toggleFreeze\fR procedure toggles the frozen state of
the output terminal window identified by \fIpath\fR on and off. New
text written to the terminal window normally scrolls the window so
that the text is visible. No automatic scrolling will take place in
the frozen state. The procedure returns a boolean indicating whether
the terminal is currently in the frozen state or not.

.TP
.B tnmTerm::toggleWrap \fIpath\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::toggleWrap\fR procedure toggles the line wrapping mode
of the output terminal window identified by \fIpath\fR. Normally, text
lines that exceed the line length of the terminal window will not be
shown completely. If the wrap mode is on, the long text lines will
wrap around and be displayed in several lines in the terminal
window. The procedure returns a boolean indicating whether the
terminal is currently in wrap mode or not.

.TP
.B tnmTerm::toggleXScroll \fIpath\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::toggleYScroll\fR procedure toggles the visibility of
the horizontal scrollbar attached to the output terminal window
identified by \fIpath\fR. The procedure returns a boolean indicating
whether the scrollbar is visible or not.

.TP
.B tnmTerm::toggleYScroll \fIpath\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::toggleYScroll\fR procedure toggles the visibility of
the vertical scrollbar attached to the output terminal window
identified by \fIpath\fR. The procedure returns a boolean indicating
whether the scrollbar is visible or not.

.TP
.B tnmTerm::save \fIpath\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::save\fR procedure issues a dialog to save the
contents of the terminal window identified by \fIpath\fR into
a text file.

.TP
.B tnmTerm::load \fIpath\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::load\fR procedure issues a dialog to read a text
file into the terminal window identified by \fIpath\fR.

.TP
.B tnmTerm::print \fIpath\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::print\fR procedure issues a dialog to send the
contents of the terminal window identified by \fIpath\fR to a
local printer.

.TP
.B tnmTerm::email \fIpath\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::email\fR procedure issues a dialog to send the
contents of the terminal window identified by \fIpath\fR via email.

.TP
.B tnmTerm::close \fIpath\fR
The \fBtnmTerm::close\fR procedure closes and destroys an 
existing output terminal identified by \fIpath\fR.
