.SH NAME
tnmSmxProfiles \- A Tcl package of procedures that implement common SMX runtime security profiles.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION

The tnmSmxProfiles package provides a set of Tcl command procedures
which implement SMX runtime security profiles.

.SH USING THE PACKAGE

The tnmSmxProfiles package is loaded into a Tcl interpreter by using
the following sequence of Tcl commands:

.CS
package require tnm
.br
package require tnmSmxProfiles $tnm(version)
.CE

All the tnmSmxProfiles commands live in the tnmSmxProfiles
namespace. You can import these commands into the current namespace by
using the following Tcl command:

.CS
namespace import tnmSmxProfiles::*
.CE

Note that it is actually required to import the procedures into the
global namespace since the SMX protocol is not capable to transfer
runtime security profile names with a namespace separator.

.SH COMMANDS

.TP
.B tnmSmxProfiles::safe \fIslave\fR
The tnmSmxProfiles::safe procedure implements a safe runtime security
profile which only supports safe Tcl commands.

.TP
.B tnmSmxProfiles::snmp \fIslave\fR
The tnmSmxProfiles::snmp procedure implements a safe runtime security
profile which provides access to the tnm::snmp and the tnm::mib commands.

.TP
.B tnmSmxProfiles::tnm \fIslave\fR
The tnmSmxProfiles::tnm procedure implements a runtime security
profile which supports all tnm commands. This is not a very safe
profile since it allows scripts arbitrary use of the network.
Furthermore, scripts can issue syslog messages and disturb the system
in other unpleasant ways.
