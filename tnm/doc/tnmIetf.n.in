.SH NAME
tnmIetf \- A Tcl package containing information about IETF NM standards.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION

The tnmIetf package provides a database of IETF network management
standards and command procedures to access the database. The
information provided in this file can be used to generate
cross-reference material. In particular, this package contains all the
RFC documents and the working groups responsible for them.

.SH USING THE PACKAGE

The tnmIetf package is loaded into a Tcl interpreter by using the
following sequence of Tcl commands:

.CS
package require tnm
.br
package require tnmIetf $tnm(version)
.CE

All the tnmIetf commands live in the tnmIetf namespace. You can import
these commands into the current namespace by using the following Tcl
command:

.CS
namespace import tnmIetf::*
.CE

It is however suggested to import commands explicitely or to use the
full name in scripts to avoid name clashes.
